About the organization.

I believe that the idea of large organizations is not very useful. Large Organizations tend to accumulate more power than is good for them. This organization is my attempt at coming up with a society that can work with a new model of development; a model based on small, local organizations that have an open system of operation. 

Organizations right now work very similar to a microscope. They tend to get away from users as they become larger. As an organization scales, its viewpoint mutates from singular to cluster-like. As multiple organizations become so, they find that in a sea of opportunities, singular is a small fish; while the other, large organizations are bigger fish. They tend to focus on gaining larger clusters', and hence larger organizations' attention rather than singular's. This pattern is valid for governments as well as product companies or other such organizations.

Having smaller clusters can allow organizations to stay lean and healthy in terms of contribution towards singulars' way of life.
